I've been doing a good amount of public speaking lately and it looks like I'll be doing a good amount more in the forseeable future. I really enjoy public speaking, which I think is because I used to be in theater in high school and college and sort of miss that entertaining aspect of my life.  These conference talks are both fun for me in that I get to meet a lot of people and teach new things to people, but also that I get to entertain and perform for an audience again.  I think that terrifies a lot of people, but I rather enjoy it.

Anyhow, here is a list of some of the gigs I have coming up and some that I have done recently.
